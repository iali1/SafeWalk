Project Kickoff
Vision: Create an app that discreetly communicates a need for a Macalester Student to be picked up by a safewalk personnel. 

Audience for launch: The workers at safewalk and Macalester students who use the service.

Risks:
Safewalk supervisor(s) must be on board with the project.
There are 2 different end users: Macalester Students and Safewalk workers (meaning two different UI).
Preventing people to use the app when they are out of range. (GPS?).
Can we create an interactive map?
Preventing people to use the app as a prank.
Can we verify a phone number?
Getting the phone to communicate with another phone/computer.


Phases:
Phase 1: Sending an SMS message from Macalester student to safewalk. Since it's an SMS message safewalk will be able to have the phone number automatically. SMS message includes name and address of Macalester student to be picked up.

Phase 2: Use GPS to locate user. The app should convert the coordinates to send an accurate address to safewalk and if possible send a radius of location accuracy.

Phase 3: Authenticate user. Account linked to two different UI.

Phase 4: Determine if the user is in the specified range

Ideas for future phases:
Let the user know when Safewalk is available, when it isn't and when it is but all the workers are away from the desk at other walks.
Have a feature where the student can set a pick up time. For example having an option that says pick me up at x O'clock, or pick me up in 15, 30, 45, 60 minutes.
